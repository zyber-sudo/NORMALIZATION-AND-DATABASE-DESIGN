### NORMALIZATION-AND-DATABASE-DESIGN

#### INTRODUCTION

<p>
For this assessment, you will be creating an entity-relationship (ER) model, databases, tables, and queries for two fictional small businesses.<br>
  
To complete this assessment, you will use SQL to test and run a database application that you will develop. After running the code, you will take a screenshot of your results and paste the screenshot into a document that you will submit.<br>

The work you complete for each part of the assessment (i.e., the design models and diagrams, tables, written explanations, SQL script code, and screenshot results from running your SQL scripts in a SQL tool) should be saved as a single PDF file that you will submit.
